# Stone, Paper and Scissors

## Overview
This project provides a versatile and cross-platform application, developed using Python, Java, and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The purpose of the project is to create a flexible framework for managing tasks and organizing data.

## Platforms
The project is structured to run seamlessly on three different platforms:
- **Python:** Utilizing Python for task automation and data processing.
- **Java:** Incorporating Java for a robust backend server and business logic.
- **Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):** Employing a web-based stack for an interactive and user-friendly frontend.

## Installation
1. **Python:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed (`python --version` should return a valid version).
   - Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Run the Python application: `python sps.py`.

2. **Java:**
   - Ensure you have Java installed (`java -version` should return a valid version).
   - Run the Java application: `java sps.java`.

3. **Web Technologies:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage
- The Python application provides a command-line interface for task management.
- The Java backend exposes REST APIs for interacting with the application's core features.
- The web-based frontend offers a graphical user interface for a seamless user experience.
